## 13. Formlister: Add Space To Message Content / Paragraphs On New Lines

The following tutorial is based around the "Create a Form Report" tutorial.

The following code is required:

```
<p>This is the information entered by <b>[+name.value+]</b> in the websites contact form.</p>
<p>The full details are as follows:</p>
<p>Name: [+name.value+]</p>
<p>Email: [+email.value+]</p>
<p>Phone: [+phone.value+]</p>
<p>Subject: [+subject.value+]</p>
<p>Message:<br>[+message.value+]</p>
<p>Send a Reply: <a href="mailto:[+email.value+]?subject=RE: [+subject.value+]">[+email.value+]</a></p>
```

What we are primarily interested in is the following element:

```
<p>Message:<br>[+message.value+]</p>
```

By default, when the code above is used, your message is put onto one line, which obviously makes life somewhat hard when you try to decifer what's in the text.

A solution is to tell the form, when it's processed / submitted, to put all new lines (as typed into the form on your server) on to a new line.

How we do this is as follows:

**Change:**

```
<p>Message:<br>[+message.value+]</p>
```

**Into**

```
<p>Message:<br>[+message:strip_tags:nl2br+]</p>
```

As you can see the "value" attribute has been removed and additional conditions have been added directly to the "message" property.

**Code Breakdown**

```
:strip_tags
```

HTML and PHP tags are stripped [(read the PHP documentation)](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strip-tags.php)

```
:nl2br
```

Outputs the content with `<br />` or `<br>` inserted before all newlines [(read the PHP documentation)](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.nl2br.php)

The result can be seen in the image below:

As you can see, the message area in the Formlister report now has 3 paragraphs, instead of one text block (as seen in the first image).

In both examples, the text was added in the same way, copy and paste, you can test this yourself, the following block is the original text used:

```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam non feugiat dui. Duis dapibus id nulla ac aliquam. Sed et convallis ligula. Nam dapibus nulla eu enim maximus pharetra. In hac habitasse platea dictumst.

Mauris at est dignissim, sollicitudin quam vitae, bibendum neque. Ut non arcu velit. Aliquam ullamcorper maximus tellus, eu consequat eros interdum et. Suspendisse aliquet libero odio, eget viverra magna feugiat ac.

Phasellus aliquam a tortor a consequat. Mauris sed leo eget tortor cursus tincidunt. Cras dapibus est in nulla pulvinar lacinia vitae at metus. Aenean dictum tempus luctus. Nulla rutrum viverra neque, a tincidunt nunc gravida a. Maecenas commodo orci in cursus egestas. Mauris maximus, orci nec feugiat molestie, libero mauris malesuada ligula, quis malesuada quam tortor eu lorem.
```

**Final Step:**

When calling your Formlister form, you need to add the following

```
[!FormLister?
&isHtml=`1`
...
!]
```

If you already have `&isHtml` in your form set to "0" change it to "1".
