## 05. Formlister: Create a Form Report

All forms need to be able to be reviewed in some form or another, either plain text or in HTML.

* [Default setup in Evo](#default-setup-in-Evo)
* [Build Your Own Report](#build-your-own-report)
* [Add the Report to FormLister](#add-the-report-to-formLister)
* [Add Date & Time](#add-date--time)

The following information is here to help you create your own form reports

### Default setup in Evo

When you install Evo with the pre-configured site, you will find the default form report in the chunks section, under the name "ContactFormReport".

As of writing this example the chunk contained the following:

```
<p>This is a response sent by <b>[+name+]</b> using the feedback form on the website. The details of the message follow below:</p>
<p>Name: [+name+]</p>
<p>Email: [+email+]</p>
<p>Regarding: [+subject+]</p>
<p>comments:<br />[+message+]</p>
<p>You can use this link to reply: <a href="mailto:[+email+]?subject=RE: [+subject+]">[+email+]</a></p>
```

### Build Your Own Report

This is quite simple, because you already have all of the fields in your form, it's now simply a question of copying the values.

Our form (based on: Basic Contact Form - V.1) has all the information we require, here the form code:

```
<form action="[~[*id*]~]" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="formid" value="ContactForm">
  <!-- Name -->
  <div class="[+name.errorClass+][+name.requiredClass+]">
    <label for="name">Name</label>
    <input type="text" name="name" id="name" placeholder="Name" value="[+name.value+]">
  </div>
  <!-- Email -->
  <div class="[+email.errorClass+][+email.requiredClass+]">
    <label for="email">Email</label>
    <input type="email" name="email" id="email" placeholder="Email" value="[+email.value+]">
  </div>
  <!-- Phone Number -->
  <div class="[+phone.errorClass+][+phone.requiredClass+]">
    <label for="phone">Phone</label>
    <input type="tel" name="phone" id="phone" placeholder="Only Enter Digits" value="[+phone.value+]">
  </div>
  <!-- Subject -->
  <div class="[+subject.errorClass+][+subject.requiredClass+]">
    <label for="subject">Subject</label>
    <input type="text" name="subject" id="subject" placeholder="Subject" value="[+subject.value+]">
  </div>
  <!-- Message -->
  <div class="[+message.errorClass+][+message.requiredClass+]">
    <label for="message">Message</label>
    <textarea rows="10" name="message" id="message" placeholder="Type your message here">[+message.value+]</textarea>
  </div> 
  <!-- Submit Button -->
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

All we need from the above code are the named values:

```
[+name.value+]
[+email.value+]
[+phone.value+]
[+subject.value+]
[+message.value+]
```

Putting this into something that is readable and makes sense is the next step:

```
<p>This is the information entered by <b>[+name.value+]</b> in the websites contact form.</p>
<p>The full details are as follows:</p>
<p>Name: [+name.value+]</p>
<p>Email: [+email.value+]</p>
<p>Phone: [+phone.value+]</p>
<p>Subject: [+subject.value+]</p>
<p>Message:<br>[+message.value+]</p>
<p>Send a Reply: <a href="mailto:[+email.value+]?subject=RE: [+subject.value+]">[+email.value+]</a></p>
```

How you output the information in the report is down to you, the above is simply an example.

### Add the Report to FormLister

There are two possibilities to add a report to the FormLister call, either with a chunk or directly in the FormLister call.

In both cases the parameter is:

```
[!FormLister?
BLAH…
&reportTpl=``
!]
```

**Using a chunk:**

Create a chunk, call it whatever you want and then add the name of the chunk to the parameter, our chunk uses the name "ContactFormReport".

```
[!FormLister?
BLAH…
&reportTpl=`ContactFormReport`
!]
```

The chunk "ContactFormReport" (in this example) contains the following:

```
<p>This is the information entered by <b>[+name.value+]</b> in the websites contact form.</p>
<p>The full details are as follows:</p>
<p>Name: [+name.value+]</p>
<p>Email: [+email.value+]</p>
<p>Phone: [+phone.value+]</p>
<p>Subject: [+subject.value+]</p>
<p>Message:<br>[+message.value+]</p>
<p>Send a Reply: <a href="mailto:[+email.value+]?subject=RE: [+subject.value+]">[+email.value+]</a></p>
```

**Directly in the call:**

```
[!FormLister?
BLAH…
&reportTpl=`@CODE:
<p>This is the information entered by <b>[+name.value+]</b> in the websites contact form.</p>
<p>The full details are as follows:</p>
<p>Name: [+name.value+]</p>
<p>Email: [+email.value+]</p>
<p>Phone: [+phone.value+]</p>
<p>Subject: [+subject.value+]</p>
<p>Message:<br>[+message.value+]</p>
<p>Send a Reply: <a href="mailto:[+email.value+]?subject=RE: [+subject.value+]">[+email.value+]</a></p>`
!]
```

### Add Date & Time

If you want to add a date and time to your form report you can, simply add the following (where you want it to be shown) to the report:

```
[+form.date.value+]
```

**Example:**

```
<p>This is the information entered by <b>[+name.value+]</b> in the websites contact form, on the [+form.date.value+].</p>
```

Depending on your chosen language, the date will be shown in form from: "Month.Date.Year at Hour.Minute.Second".

As defined in: assets/snippets/FormLister/core/lang/LANGUAGE/form.inc.php

```
$_lang['form.dateFormat'] = 'm.d.Y \a\t H:i:s';
```

You can customise the output by either:

* modifying the language file for the language you have chosen
* adding a language lexicon

If you would like more information about customising languages, please take a look at the tutorial in this section about language customisation / custom languages.

**An example:**

```
&lang=`dateformat`
&lexicon=`{
    "dateformat":{
        "form.dateFormat":"l d F Y \\a\\t H:i:sa"
    }
}`
```

The above example results in something like this:

```
Monday 05 March 2018 at 17:00:30pm
```

**Note:** In this example, "am" and "pm" are displayed depending on the time of day.

Please read the official [PHP date function](https://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php) documentation to apply your custom output.
