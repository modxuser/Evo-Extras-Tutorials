## 04. Doclister: Tagged blogging with Ditto - Conversion (ex.1)

The aim of this tutorial is to convert the original Ditto tutorial (Tagged blogging with Ditto (ex.1)) into a working solution for Doclister.

This tutorial uses elements found in some of my other Doclister tutorials, such as calls, pagination etc.

The code will not be broken down this time as sufficient information can be found in other tutorials describing what the elements in the calls do.

This tutorial consists of multiple parts / sections:

1. Create a tag section consisting of documents representing categories used in a pre-defined template variable
2. Create a blog section with child documents and attach the tag template variable
3. Display category tags in 2 different places - Blog overview page summary & Blog page content
4. Filter content in categories found in the tag section

For this tutorial you will need to have the following snippets installed:

1. Doclister
2. tagLinks

```
**IMPORTANT:**

As of writing this tutorial I wasn't able to get the TagSaver plugin working, as such, it won't be used in this tutorial, but, if you want to, you can install it using the instructions found in the tutorial.

It could save you time at a later stage, that is, if and when I get help to complete the Tagsaver tutorial.
