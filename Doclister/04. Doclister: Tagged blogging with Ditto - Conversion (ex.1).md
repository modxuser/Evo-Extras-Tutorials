The aim of this tutorial is to convert the original Ditto tutorial (Tagged blogging with Ditto (ex.1)) into a working solution for Doclister.

This tutorial uses elements found in some of my other Doclister tutorials, such as calls, pagination etc.

The code will not be broken down this time as sufficient information can be found in other tutorials describing what the elements in the calls do.

This tutorial consists of multiple parts / sections:

1. Create a tag section consisting of documents representing categories used in a pre-defined template variable
2. Create a blog section with child documents and attach the tag template variable
3. Display category tags in 2 different places - Blog overview page summary & Blog page content
4. Filter content in categories found in the tag section
5. Modify tagLinks snippet for category tagging and URL changes


This tutorial was developed in Evo 1.4.14, the page template used is from the original "Evo" sample website which uses Bootstrap. Numerous Bootstrap classes are used within Doclister element templates e.g pagination etc.

For this tutorial you must have the following snippets installed:

1. Doclister
2. tagLinks

<details>
 <summary><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> TagSaver Plugin</summary>
 <p>As of writing this tutorial I wasn't able to get the TagSaver plugin working, as such, it won't be used in this tutorial.</p>
 <p><strong>BUT:</strong> if you want to, you can install the plugin and the database tables using the instructions found in the first 2 steps of the tutorial: &quot;03. Doclister: Tagging using TagSaver&quot;.</p>
 <p>This way, if the TagSaver method can (eventually) be used, you won't have to go back and re-save all pages that use tags, as they will have already been saved into the TagSaver database tables.</p>
 <p>It could save you time and stress at a later stage, that is, if and when I get help to complete the Tagsaver tutorial.</p>

# Section 1: Setting Up Category Tagging

As this tutorial is about **category tagging**, we need to pre-define what categories we want to use in the website.

For this specific tutorial, we will be using colours.

To note is: we can add categories at a later stage, but if you wish to add these categories to older posts, you will have to revisit the post / page and select it/them and re-save the document.

### Step 1 - Create A Category Template Variable:

There is no difference to creating any other TV.

The "input option values" used in this tutorial are as follows:

```
Aqua||Black||Blue||Fushsia||Gray||Green||Lime||Maroon||Navy||Olive||Purple||Red||Silver||Teal||White||Yellow
```

You can simply copy and paste the above values into your own TV. The following settings are for this tutorial only, you can name the TV as you wish, you just need to be sure to refer to the right TV name later.

**TV Settings**

- TV Name: **myTags**
- Input Type: **Check Box**
- Widget: **Delimited List**
    - Widget Delimiter: **a comma**

You TV should basically look like the following image:

![tag-tv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1859868/113714392-a208d900-96e8-11eb-9710-3c2f472bb46f.png)

In the image above, you can see that "Existing Category" has the name "Tagging" - to ensure no confusion, this is the Evo Admin panel category, it has nothing to do with the category tagging.

It is solely used in the Evo Admin Panel to keep things clean and sorted - the control panel "Tagging" category will be seen a lot in this tutorial, so please don't get confused.

At the bottom of the image you can see that this TV (template variable) has already been attached to the "BlogPost" template - this will be explained shortly.

Now that we have our categories we can set-up all of the category landing pages.

### Step 2 - Create Category Landing Pages:

The landing pages are created no different to any other pages.

##### Create A Parent Folder

First of all, create a parent / top level document and make it a folder, use the following settings:

![mytags-page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1859868/113717458-ecd82000-96eb-11eb-85d7-d065ce9271d3.jpg)

You can add whatever you want to the content area of this page / document or simply re-direct it to the first child document.

For testing purposes, I suggest you add the following Doclister call to the content area:

```
<h1>[*pagetitle*]</h1>
[[DocLister?  
&parents=`[*id*]` 
&ownerTPL=`@CODE:<ul class="list-group list-unstyled">[+dl.wrap+]</ul>` 
&tpl=`@CODE:<li><a class="list-group-item list-group-item-action" href="[+url+]">[+pagetitle+]</a></li>` 
&orderBy=`menuindex ASC` 
&addWhereList=`hidemenu=1 AND published=1`
]]
```

The call will simply list all of the child pages in the parents content area when viewed in a browser. An example can be seen here:

![mytags](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1859868/113720499-fdd66080-96ee-11eb-823c-d1e4e0ab9b6b.png)

#### Create A Landing Page Template

Before we create the category landing pages, we need to create a page specific template for these pages only.

As this tutorial is based on the sample website that comes when you install Evo, we need to use the template that is used for the sample site.

1. Go to your templates and click on the link for: **EVO startup - Bootstrap(4)** > 1.0 Sample template in Bootstrap.

   You should now have something like the following image in front of you:

   ![evo-startup-bootstrap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1859868/113727012-0893f400-96f5-11eb-8807-2617bcde27a6.png)

2. In the top right hand corner you have the options to: **Save**, **Duplicate**, **Delete** or **Cancel**.

3. Click "**Duplicate**" and confirm the pop-up with "**OK**".

4. Now rename the template to **Tags** (Template Name) and save it.

   You should now have something like the following image in front of you:

   ![tags-tpl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1859868/113728805-b05df180-96f6-11eb-972f-c1c75ee0b1f7.png)

5. In the Template code area, find the following code:

   ```
   <h1>[*#longtitle*]</h1>
   [*#content*]
   
   [[if? &is=`[*parent*]:=:2` &then=`@TPL:Comments`]]
   ```

   You should now have something like the following in front of you:

   ![template code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1859868/113728886-c66bb200-96f6-11eb-83a6-ab3fece8af83.png)

6. Remove the code from point 5 above and replace it with the following Doclister call:

   ```
   <h1>Tag: [*pagetitle*] (Total of: [+list.count+])</h1>
   <br>
   [!Doclister? 
   &id=`list` 
   &parents=`50` 
   &showParent=`0` 
   &orderBy=`id DESC` 
   &ownerTPL=`@CODE:<ul class="list-group list-unstyled">[+dl.wrap+]</ul>` 
   &tpl=`@CODE:<li><a class="list-group-item list-group-item-action" href="[+url+]">[+pagetitle+]</a></li>` 
   &noneWrapOuter=`0` 
   &noneTPL=`@CODE: <strong>Sorry, there are no documents using the tag: [*pagetitle*].</strong>` 
   &display=`2` 
   &addWhereList=`hidemenu=1 AND published=1` 
   &filters=`tv:myTags:like:[*alias*]` 
   &paginate=`pages` 
   &PrevNextAlwaysShow=`1` 
   &pageAdjacents=`2` 
   &TplWrapPaginate=`@CODE:<nav><ul class="pagination">[+wrap+]</ul></nav>` 
   &TplFirstP=`@CODE:<li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="[+link+]" title="First">&laquo;</a></li>` 
   &TplFirstI=`@CODE:<li class="page-item disabled"><span class="page-link" title="First">&laquo;</span></li>` 
   &TplPrevP=`@CODE:<li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="[+link+]" title="Previous">&lsaquo;</a></li>` 
   &TplPrevI=`@CODE:<li class="page-item disabled"><span class="page-link" title="Previous">&lsaquo;</span></li>` 
   &TplNextP=`@CODE:<li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="[+link+]" title="Next">&rsaquo;</a></li>` 
   &TplNextI=`@CODE:<li class="page-item disabled"><span class="page-link" title="Next">&rsaquo;</span></li>` 
   &TplLastP=`@CODE:<li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="[+link+]" title="Last">&raquo;</a></li>` 
   &TplLastI=`@CODE:<li class="page-item disabled"><span class="page-link" title="Last">&raquo;</span></li>` 
   &TplPage=`@CODE:<li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="[+link+]" title="[+num+]">[+num+]</a></li>`  
   &TplCurrentPage=`@CODE:<li class="page-item active"><span class="page-link" title="[+num+]">[+num+]</span></li>`  
   &TplDotsPage=`@CODE:<li>...</li>`
   !]
   <p>Viewing <strong>[+list.from+]</strong> - <strong>[+list.to+]</strong> of <strong>[+list.count+]</strong> for <em>[*pagetitle*]</em> | Page <strong>[+list.current+]</strong> of <strong>[+list.totalPages+]</strong></p>
   [+list.pages+]
   ```
   
   Change the `&parents=` from "50" to your Blog parent ID, if you haven't created a blog parent yet, come back here later and change the ID when you know what it is.


#### Create Category Landing Pages

Now that our template is ready to be used, we can start creating pages for our categories.

We have already [created a parent folder](#create-a-parent-folder), so we can go straight into creating the landing pages. Again here, no difference to creating any other pages.

What you need to do is create a page for each of the input values from your **myTags** TV:

```
Aqua||Black||Blue||Fushsia||Gray||Green||Lime||Maroon||Navy||Olive||Purple||Red||Silver||Teal||White||Yellow
```

Due to tagLinks changing words to lowercase, each of the landing pages alias field must be written in lowercase.

e.g "Aqua" would in this case be rendered in the HTML source code by tagLinks as "my-tags/aqua".

Your landing page(s) should look something like this:

![landing-pages](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1859868/113843281-bd7cee00-9793-11eb-90db-4c64a182b833.jpg)

Note that your "Resource content" field stays empty - you only need to set-up the page as shown in the above image

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

For this tutorial, the names that have been used are "single words", Aqua, Black etc. if you use names like "Light Blue" you will need to read "[Section 5: Modify the tagLinks Snippet](#section-5-modify-the-taglinks-snippet)" about the changes that are required in the tagLinks snippets.

# Section 2: Basic Blog Setup

If you installed and are using the sample website you will already have a "Blog" page / folder.

If like me, you removed the default content pages and started from scratch, you will have to create a new parent document / folder.

Your Blog parent document should have these settings:

![blog-overview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1859868/113848214-8826cf00-9798-11eb-9cc6-2cfa2761650f.jpg)

Add the following Doclister call to the "Resource content" field:

```
[!DocLister? 
&parents=`[*id*]` 
&showParent=`0` 
&display=`2` 
&tvPrefix=`` 
&tvList=`myTags` 
&renderTV=`myTags` 
&sortBy=`menuindex` 
&sortDir=`DESC` 
&dateSource=`createdon` 
&dateFormat=`%d.%m.%Y` 
&extender=`user` 
&usertype=`mgr` 
&userFields=`createdby,publishedby` 
&summary=`notags,len:250` 
&tpl=`BlogSummary` 
&paginate=`pages` 
&PrevNextAlwaysShow=`1` 
&pageAdjacents=`2` 
&TplWrapPaginate=`@CODE:<nav><ul id="pagination" class="pagination">[+wrap+]</ul></nav>` 
&TplFirstP=`@CODE:<li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="[+link+]" title="First">&laquo;</a></li>` 
&TplFirstI=`@CODE:<li class="page-item disabled"><span class="page-link" title="First">&laquo;</span></li>` 
&TplPrevP=`@CODE:<li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="[+link+]" title="Previous">&lsaquo;</a></li>` 
&TplPrevI=`@CODE:<li class="page-item disabled"><span class="page-link" title="Previous">&lsaquo;</span></li>` 
&TplNextP=`@CODE:<li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="[+link+]" title="Next">&rsaquo;</a></li>` 
&TplNextI=`@CODE:<li class="page-item disabled"><span class="page-link" title="Next">&rsaquo;</span></li>` 
&TplLastP=`@CODE:<li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="[+link+]" title="Last">&raquo;</a></li>` 
&TplLastI=`@CODE:<li class="page-item disabled"><span class="page-link" title="Last">&raquo;</span></li>` 
&TplPage=`@CODE:<li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="[+link+]" title="[+num+]">[+num+]</a></li>`  
&TplCurrentPage=`@CODE:<li class="page-item active"><span class="page-link" title="[+num+]">[+num+]</span></li>`  
&TplDotsPage=`@CODE:<li>...</li>`
!]
<p>Showing <strong>[+current+]</strong> of <strong>[+totalPages+]</strong> Pages</p>
<div id="dl_pages">[+pages+]</div>
```

Taking a closer look at the Docliste call, you will see:

```
&display=`2`

&tpl=`BlogSummary`
```

The amount of results that you wish to display is your choice, change "2" to whatever you want it to be.

The template that is used to display the results in the blog page content is set here to use a chunk, called **BlogSummary**.

Why use a chunk, why not use inline code: Simply because Doclister doesn't render the tagLinks call correctly when it is called inline (the tagLinks call will be added later).

**Create The BlogSummary Chunk**

Go to the chunks section in your admin panel and create a chunk using the name **BlogSummary**

Add the following code to the "Chunk code (html)" field:

```
<div class="dl_summaryPost">
  <h3><a href="[+url+]">[+pagetitle+]</a></h3>
  <div class="dl_info">By <strong>[+user.fullname.createdby+]</strong> on [+date+]</div>
  <p>[+summary+]</p>
</div>
```





































# Section 5: Modify the tagLinks Snippet

tagLinks was developed to use query parameters, it uses the "?tags=" parameter at the end of a url e.g domain.com/mytags?tag=aqua.

We want it to create a different kind of URL, we want it to replicate a document e.g domain.com/my-tags/aqua

#### Modify The URL Output

We can do this by modifying the tagLinks code slightly, find the following code in the tagLinks snippet:

```
/**
* Build the URL
*/
$url_seperator = (strpos($path, '?') === false)?'?':$amp;
$doc_path = $path.$url_seperator.$idDitto.'tags=';
```

Change it to this:

```
/*
Build the URL
$url_seperator = (strpos($path, '?') === false)?'?':$amp;
$doc_path = $path.$url_seperator.$idDitto.'tags=';
*/
$doc_path = $path.'/';
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

If you have "End Container URL with Slash" in your Evo configuration set to "yes", you need to remove the forward slash in `$path`.

If you don't remove the slash you will have two slashes in the URL, the URL will look something like this: "mydomain.com/my-tags//green"

When the slash is removed from `$path` we get the correct output, the result looks like this: "mydomain.com/my-tags/green"

```
$doc_path = $path.'';
```

#### White Space In Category Names

tagLinks, per default, replaces empty spaces with a plus sign, you can't use a plus sign in a documents alias field because Evo removes / sanitizes it, which means the tagLinks snippet has to be modified.

Find the following code in the tagLinks snippet (2 instances):

```
$url = urlencode(trim($tvarray[$x]));
```

Change both instances to this:

```
$out = trim($tvarray[$x]);
$url = str_replace(" ", "-", $out);
```

What this does is tell tagLinks to replace white space between words with a minus sign.

If you use underscores in your landing page(s) alias field, change the minus sign to an underscore
