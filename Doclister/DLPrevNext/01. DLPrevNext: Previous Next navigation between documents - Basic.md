## 01. DLPrevNext: Previous Next navigation between documents - Basic

If you don't already have the "**DLPrevNext**" snippet installed into your system do the following:

Login and go to your snippet section, create a new snippet and call it "**DLPrevNext**"

Add the following code:

```
<?php
return require MODX_BASE_PATH.'assets/snippets/DocLister/snippet.DLPrevNext.php';
```

Job done.

**The snippet call:**

```
[[DLPrevNext?
&parents=`[*parent*]` 
&prevnextTPL=`@CODE:<nav><ul>[+prev+]<li>|</li>[+next+]</ul></nav>` 
&prevTPL=`@CODE:<li><a href="[+url+]"><span class="fas fa-chevron-left"></span> [+menutitle+]</a></li>` 
&nextTPL=`@CODE:<li><a href="[+url+]">[+menutitle+] <span class="fas fa-chevron-right"></span></a></li>` 
]]
```

This is a very basic snippet, it simply lets you navigate between child documents and there are no complicated settings.

The links are shown as a loop, so once at the end of the document list, it starts again from the first document.

**Notes:**

Although this snippet uses the Doclister core, it doesn't use all of the parameters that are available and some parameters cause unexpected problems

An example: the "ownerTPL" in the Doclister core is normaly used to create a wrapper for the rendered code, here, it has to be within the "prevnextTPL"
